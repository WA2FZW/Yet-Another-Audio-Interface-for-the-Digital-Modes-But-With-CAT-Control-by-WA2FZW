Yet Another Audio Interface for the Digital Modes (But With CAT Control)
Version 2.0 by John Price – WA2FZW

A while back, my primary radio went belly up, and while it was out for
repairs, I thought I might drag out my old Swan-250C 6 meter rig so I
could at least get on the air. I had built a simple hand-wired audio
interface for it, but couldn’t find it, so I designed a new one!

The audio portion of the device is pretty standard. It is a hybrid of
the “Easy Digi” audio interface and a few other designs that are
floating around. What’s different about this one is that I added an
Arduino Nano processor so that the transmitter could be keyed via CAT
control instead of using the more common RS-232 hack.
